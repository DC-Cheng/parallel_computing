# Brief 

The repos is to show my work-out in paralle-computing technique - CUDA. The snnipet shows the code in C/C++ CUDA

# Action items

[ `.cu` processing ]
1. to test deviceQuery
2. to test assertion
3. to test shared memory 
4. to do convolution filtering in 2D structure of CUDA
5. to do convolution filtering in 3D structure of CUDA
